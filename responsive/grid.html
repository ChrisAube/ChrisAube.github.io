        This comes from a chicken, what else did u expect. The chicken is a
        domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from
        Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and
        younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is

        Beef Comes from cows, it is very cool by the way. Beef is the culinary
        name for meat from cattle. In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs
        and later domesticated them. Since then, numerous breeds of cattle have
        been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today,
        beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and
        poultry.
